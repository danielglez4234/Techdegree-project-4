 - I attempted to earn an “Exceeds Expectations” grade. “Extra Credit” features I added:

 Add keyboard functionality, Making the project your own.

 - CSS changes I made

 -Background color changes in the Body, Overlay, Win and Lose using a web page called "mycolor.space" to generate the color gradients,and other color changes on the keyboard when you guess and when you don't.

 -Three different fonts familys applied in the titles and letters.

  - Animations and Effects

  -The Start game button: it has a hover effect that increases the letter spacing, It has an animation that activates when Pressed making it EXPAND, change color and ROTATE 360deg.

  -The "PHRASE HUNTER" title: the one in the overlay EXPANDS when the start game button is clicked - The one in the header has an infinite movement animation that keeps it 'FLOATING'.

  -The Images of the hearts: they have an animation that makes them SHAKE every time the player makes a wrong guess.

  -the Keyboard letters: It has a hover effect that changes the border radius.
